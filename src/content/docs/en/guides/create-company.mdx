## Required permissions

| Action | Permission |
|--------|------------|
| View list | `company.viewAny` |
| View a supplier | `company.view` |
| Create | `company.create` |
| Modify | `company.update` |
| Delete | `company.delete` |

## Deletion and data preservation

When a Company is deleted:

1. **Items** keep a reference to the company name (`company_name` field)
2. **Item movements** preserve the supplier name
3. **Item prices** preserve the supplier name

This allows maintaining traceability even after a supplier is deleted.

<Aside type="caution">
  Deletion is permanent. Consider deactivating instead of deleting if you need to keep history.
