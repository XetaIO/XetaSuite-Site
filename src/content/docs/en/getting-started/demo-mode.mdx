XetaSuite comes with **demo mode disabled by default**.

## What is demo mode for?

This mode is designed to:

- Allow a **public demonstration**
- Prevent **data accumulation**
- Ensure an **always functional environment**

## Automatic database reset

In demo mode, the database is automatically reset **every 6 hours** via the command:

```bash
php artisan demo:reset
```

This command:

1. Deletes all data
2. Runs migrations
3. Re-seeds demonstration data

<Aside type="caution">
  All entered data is **temporary** and will be deleted on the next reset.
</Aside>

## Disabling demo mode

<Aside type="danger">
  If you want to use XetaSuite in a real environment (staging / production), you **must** disable demo mode.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. **Disable demo mode**

   In your `.env` file:

   ```bash
   DEMO_MODE=false
   ```

2. **Remove the reset command**

   Delete the following file:

   ```
   app/Console/Commands/ResetDemoDatabase.php
   ```

3. **Remove the scheduled task**

   In `routes/console.php`, remove any reference to:

   ```php
   Schedule::command('demo:reset')->...
   ```

4. **Configure your backups**

   Set up your own backup strategies (backups, monitoring, etc.).

</Steps>

## Why this mode exists

Demo mode allows:

- **Preventing abuse** on the public instance
- **Keeping a clean environment** for demonstrations
- **Freely testing** features without consequences

<Aside type="note">
  Demo mode is **not intended** for real production use.
</Aside>
