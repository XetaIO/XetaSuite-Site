Roles are **scoped by site** thanks to Spatie Laravel-Permission with teams mode.

## Default roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `admin` | Full access to the site |
| `manager` | Operations management |
| `user` | Read-only access |

## Create a role

### Via the interface

1. Go to **Administration** → **Roles**
2. Click **New role**
3. Name the role and select permissions
4. Save

### Via the API

```http
POST /api/v1/roles
```

```json
{
    "name": "supervisor",
    "level": 50,
    "site_id": 1,
    "permissions": [
        "material.viewAny",
        "material.view",
        "maintenance.viewAny",
        "maintenance.view",
        "maintenance.update",
        "incident.viewAny",
        "incident.view",
        "incident.update"
    ]
}
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Site assigned to role can not be changed after created.
</Aside>

## Modify a role

```http
PATCH /api/v1/roles/{id}
```

```json
{
    "name": "supervisor",
    "permissions": [
        "material.viewAny",
        "material.view",
        "material.update",
        "maintenance.*"
    ]
}
```

## Permissions by module

See all permissions [permissions page](/en/admin/permissions/).

## Delete a role

```http
DELETE /api/v1/roles/{id}
```

<Aside type="caution">
  A role with assigned users cannot be deleted. Reassign users first.
